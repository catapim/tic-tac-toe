# Python TIC TAC TOE

Tic tac toe, ta te ti or "el gato".

## The repository

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made to practice decorators.


## Comments

The comments are in spanish, as this is my native language.  I decided to write the readme in english to practice a little :p

Every method has a doc-string so you can understand why is there.  There are a couple of variables with docstrings too.  Pay attention to the comments with "#", they explain certain decisions taken. 

Feel free to use it as an inspiration for your own projects.

## PR?

Feel free to send pull requests if you want to suggest improvements.

Happy coding!
